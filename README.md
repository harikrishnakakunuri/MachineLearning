# Hello there,
I have created a sample dataset to train MachineLearing model then provide predictions results on SCHOOL fee details. 
In the SchoolFee dataset you find columns of StudentClass and SchoolFee with some values. By using that dataset we follow below steps:
1. # Import the dataset
2. # Splitting data into training set and test set
3. # Train the Machine by using Linear Regression Algorithm
4. # Predict the training and test data results.
Libraries used : Numpy, MatplotLib, Pandas, scikitlearn
